<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/dc/b7/44/dcb7440a53babdca7f48b2fd7604d9ff--presumed-Innocent-google-search.jpg" title="Dangerous Innocent: Handle with care" alt="Dangerous Innocent: Handle with care" width="244" height="244">The Innocent are snuggly with each other, so you just gotta find large tracks of Innocent and unsuspicious looking footprints. Follow them and you should find a flock of the Innocent. Just dive in and grab one out.<br>
Beware of the so called <q>presumed Innocent</q> though. They should only be consumed after a verdict was reached as a certificate of Innocent quality.</p>

<p>Nowadays every store worth their name has state of the art innocence detectors on offer. The prices start at 399$(638.4m) and will drastically simplify your life as a hunter of Innocents.</p>
<h3 id="C2">Part 2: Feasting on the Innocent</h3>
<p>Stab into the brain of the Innocent one. Alternatively you can cut oben the chest and rip out the still beating heart. Use pepper, salt and a hint of coriander to season it to your liking. If possible roast their flesh over an open fire, but any kind of frying or roasting is possible. If you want to store it for longer times, leave the Innocent corspe in salt for 2 weeks and store it over the winter like that.</p>

<h3>Pro-Tip</h3>
<p>Flamethrowers are a great way to use Parts 1 and 2 together and can be fun for the whole family.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Sunday clothes burn especially well in larger groups. Do note hesitate to rain fire from above too. However we can not recommend using napalm for your project, as it tends to stick to the especially tender Innocent, burning their flesh to a crisp.</div>
